# NAS on Raspberry Pi 

In this project we are building a Network Attached Storage (NAS) using a Raspberry pi 4. We have used owncloud and nextcloud setup. A NAS device is a storage device connected to a network that allows storage and retrieval of data from a central location for authorised network users and varied clients. NAS devices are flexible and scale out, meaning that as you need additional storage, you can add to what you have. NAS is like having a private cloud in the office. It’s faster, less expensive and provides all the benefits of a public cloud on site, giving you complete control.

## Advantages

- Through a NAS, we can build our own cloud storage, where we can store all our data without the need to buy cloud storage on any online platform. Its more like a one time investment for some years as we can mount any external storage devices to Pi. This ensures that we have ample space and can be upgraded over the time as per user's choice.
- Simple to operate, a dedicated IT professional is often not required
- Lower cost
- Easy data backup, so it’s always accessible when you need it
- Good at centralising data storage in a safe, reliable way
