# Pi-Owncloud
# About this project

In this project we are building a Network Attached Storage (NAS) using a Raspberry pi 4. We have used owncloud and nextcloud setup 

## Advantages

- Through a NAS, we can build our own cloud storage, where we can store all our data without the need to buy cloud storage on any online platform. Its more like a one time investment for some years as we can mount any external storage devices to Pi. This ensures that we have ample space and can be upgraded over the time as per user's choice.
